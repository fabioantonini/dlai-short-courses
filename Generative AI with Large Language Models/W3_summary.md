# Generative AI with Large Language Models -- Week 3 Summary

## 1. Scaling Laws

Model performance improves with: - Larger models - More data - More
compute

Empirical scaling laws relate loss to model size and dataset size.

## 2. Emergent Abilities

Certain capabilities emerge beyond specific scale thresholds: -
In-context learning - Zero-shot reasoning - Multi-step reasoning

## 3. Responsible AI and Safety

Important aspects: - Bias mitigation - Hallucination reduction -
Alignment with human values - Safety evaluation frameworks

## 4. Deployment Considerations

Key factors: - Latency - Inference optimization - Model compression -
Quantization

## 5. Figures and Diagrams (Analysis)

Figures illustrate: - Scaling curves (loss vs parameters) - Emergent
behavior thresholds - Deployment pipeline architecture These diagrams
emphasize trade-offs between performance, safety, and efficiency.
