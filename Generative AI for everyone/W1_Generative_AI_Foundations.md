# Generative AI for Everyone

## Foundations and Core Concepts

This document summarizes the foundational concepts of Generative AI.

## 1. The Rise of Generative AI

Generative AI is a transformative technology with significant economic
impact. It is expected to impact a large portion of knowledge work and
contribute trillions of dollars annually to the global economy.

## 2. What Is Generative AI?

Generative AI systems create new content, including text, images, audio,
and video. Unlike traditional AI systems that classify or predict,
generative AI produces original outputs.

## 3. How Large Language Models (LLMs) Work

LLMs are trained to predict the next token in a sequence. By learning
from massive corpora (hundreds of billions of words), they develop
statistical language understanding.

## 4. Strengths of LLMs

-   Writing assistance
-   Summarization
-   Question answering
-   Brainstorming
-   Code generation

## 5. Limitations

-   Hallucinations
-   Knowledge cutoff dates
-   Context window limits
-   Potential bias from training data

## 6. Prompting Best Practices

-   Be specific and detailed
-   Break tasks into steps
-   Iterate experimentally

## 7. Diffusion Models (Images)

Diffusion models generate images by gradually removing noise. They can
condition outputs on text prompts.

## 8. Key Takeaway

Generative AI is a general-purpose technology that augments human
productivity, but must be used with awareness of its limitations.
