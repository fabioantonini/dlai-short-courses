I want to share
some details about the graded exercise for this module to help set
you up for success. I've provided code in a
notebook to create and populate a database for
a simple social network, and the notebook is called
SocialNetworkDB.ipy notebook. The social network includes
people and clubs and captures both friendship and membership relationships
between these entities. Here's the task that
you have to complete. First, you're going
to create code that given a particular club, will find all of the
members of that club. Then you're going to
create code that finds everybody that a
particular person considers to be their friend. Then, lastly, you're going to create code that
given the name of a person finds all of the people that considers
them their friend. Hope you enjoy this activity,
and when you're done, I'll see you in the next module where we're going to talk
about design pattern?
