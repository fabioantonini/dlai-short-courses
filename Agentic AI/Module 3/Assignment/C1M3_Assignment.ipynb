    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

The sum of matrices is determined by the sum in F-algebra, and the product of matrices is determined by the product of mappings. The system of equations, whose matrix is a matrix of mappings, is called a system of additive equations. I considered the methods of solving system of additive equations. As an example, I consider the solution of a system of linear equations over the complex field provided that the equations contain unknown quantities and their conjugates.\\n  Linear mappings of algebra over a commutative ring preserve the operation of addition in algebra and the product of elements of the algebra by elements of the ring. The representation of tensor product A\\\\otimes A in algebra A generates the set of linear transformations of algebra A.\\n  The results of this research will be useful for mathematicians and physicists who deal with different algebras.\",\n",

    "        )\n",
    "    ]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Assuming that `msg` if of type `ChatCompletionMessage`, if you wanted to get the `name` of a `tool_call` you can do something like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    " for call in msg.tool_calls:\n",
    "    tool_name = call.function.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, the `result` variable will be created by actually calling the function associated with each tool (`tool_func`).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure the Response Call\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.\n",
    "- **Structure**: Make sure the response setup directs the model properly, ensuring the JSON format is adhered to without additional commentary.\n",

      "Radio observations of recurrent novae focus on understanding the radio emissions and dynamic processes that occur during the outburst phases of these celestial objects. Below are summaries and discussions from some notable studies on this subject:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Lesson Learned from Recurrent Novae\n",
      "In the paper titled \"Lesson learned from (some) recurrent novae,\" Mason and Walters (2013) discuss the spectra of recurrent novae such as YY Dor and nova LMC 2009, observing early decline and nebular phases. These novae, along with others of the same type, exhibit similar spectral characteristics, suggesting shared progenitor properties and post-outburst evolutionary traits [Mason & Walters, 2013](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2776v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Shocks and Ejecta Mass in Nova V1723 Aql\n",
      "The study \"Shocks and Ejecta Mass: Radio Observations of Nova V1723 Aql\" by Weston et al. (2013) investigates the evolution of the nova shell through detailed radio light curves. The observations show a rapid rise in radio flux density and a unique bump in the light curve, hinting at shocks in the ejected shell's outer region. These findings challenge the simple model of spherical shell ejection and provide insights into the mass loss history and density profile of nova ejecta [Weston et al., 2013](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2265v2).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Observations with MAGIC Telescopes\n",
      "The research involving the MAGIC telescopes explored gamma-ray emissions in novae and dwarf novae post-outburst. While focusing on different energy spectrums, these observations are crucial for comprehending acceleration processes during nova explosions, albeit with no detection of TeV gamma-ray emissions from observed novae [López-Coto et al., 2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09170v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The radio observations of recurrent novae provide valuable data about the physical processes and dynamic behavior during and after nova outbursts. Through studies employing radio and gamma-ray telescopes, researchers continue to unravel details about shocks, ejecta mass, and energy emissions, contributing to broader understanding in stellar and explosive astrophysical phenomena.\n",

      "The research involving the MAGIC telescopes explored gamma-ray emissions in novae and dwarf novae post-outburst. While focusing on different energy spectrums, these observations are crucial for comprehending acceleration processes during nova explosions, albeit with no detection of TeV gamma-ray emissions from observed novae [López-Coto et al., 2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09170v1).\n",

      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The radio observations of recurrent novae provide valuable data about the physical processes and dynamic behavior during and after nova outbursts. Through studies employing radio and gamma-ray telescopes, researchers continue to unravel details about shocks, ejecta mass, and energy emissions, contributing to broader understanding in stellar and explosive astrophysical phenomena.\n"
